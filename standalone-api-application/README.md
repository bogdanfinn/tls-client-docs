# Standalone API Application

The standalone API Application can be found here: [https://github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client-api](https://github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client-api)

This is an application which is using [gosoline](https://github.com/justtrackio/gosoline) and [TLS-Client](https://github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client) to run a simple request forwarding service with the option to use specific TLS fingerprints which are implemented in [TLS-client](https://github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client).
