# Build from source

When you want to build the application from source, make sure to also checkout this repository `https://github.com/Solem8s/gosoline` on the branch `tls-client-api` next to this project. \
Afterwards you can just run the following script: `cmd/tls-client-api/build.sh SOME_BUILD_IDENTIFIER` and it should build the binaries for you.
