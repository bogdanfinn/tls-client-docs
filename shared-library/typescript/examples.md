# Examples

Please take a look at the following Typescript Code in the repository to see examples implemented: `cffi_dist/example_typescript/`

We provide examples for the following use cases:

* GET Request
* Async Request&#x20;

In general you can also take a look at the [JavaScript Examples](../javascript/examples.md). The Typescript examples are more about how to define the types correctly and use them.
